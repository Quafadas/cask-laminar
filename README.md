# cask-laminar-stack

Example of laminar put on top of the so called "Singaporean stack". The aim is simplicitly... as far as possible inside the requirements of; 
- reload on (any) change
- database access
- Modern UI interactions
- Data viz (interactive!)
- Zero complicated effect frameworks! No scalaz, no cats, no zio, in fact, no asynchrony at all!
- JSON API
- Shared client / server code

The choices made...

1. Client written (ahem, stolen, thanks raquo) with [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar), interacting with server using laminars native Ajax integration

2. Server with [cask](https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/cask/) serving both the compiled Javascript for the client and the classic CRUD api for server-side interactions for simple deployment / development

3. Routing is via a questionable semi safe custom API concept - it's worked well for me. YMMV. Ideally, there would be tapir or endpoints4s... but none support cask... adding them added complexity against the principle above.

4. ScalaJS bundler for JS dependancies (Vega in this case)

5. Database interactions via quill

6. Testing with uTest - front and back

7.  HTTP requests to other backend services through [requests scala](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/HowtoworkwithHTTPJSONAPIsinScala.html).

8. Client server parsing are via [upickle](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/HowtoworkwithJSONinScala.html). Although this is largely abstracted away by the API - pattern match it! 

9. Simple examples of writing custom JS facades for Vega and Vega embed.

## Further ideas
1. Is it possible to publish multiple JS modules without a mass of SBT project boilerplate? Probably, it should be a homepage with links to different UIs. See laminar examples.
2. Frontend testing is non-existent (!)
3. Incorporate something from ScalabyTyped to prove the concept
4. Scala 3 (wait for the genius maintainers of quill)

## Credits
This is nothing other than glue around the genius of others. Thankyou to the maintainers of all the libraries included here. They are great.

## Development mode

Run in SBT (uses fast JS compilation, not optimized):

```
sbt> ~runDev
```

And open http://localhost:8080/

This will restart the server on any changes: shared code, client/server, assets. You should see "hello" if the server is working. 

Then try http://localhost:8080/todo. You'll probably get errors if you didn't setup the datsbase... 

Have a look at the DB folder in modules and the "application.conf" file to wire up postgres.

## Tests
It is a prerequisite to have jsdom installed, in order for the frontend tests to run. Proposal:
```
yarn add jsdom
```
Then move into an sbt console and run tests as normal

## What of scala 3? 
Quill does not yet support it's full feature set on scala 3 (to my understanding). If you don't need a database though...

Just change the scalaVersion to 3.0.0... 

## Production mode
Run in SBT (uses full JS optimization):

```
sbt> ~runProd 
```

## Docker packaging 
NOT TESTED FOR THIS TEMPLATE as it's primarily aimed at proving concepts. PR welcome should you care :-)!

```
sbt> backend/docker:publishLocal
```

Will publish the docker image with fully optimised JS code, and you can run the container:

```bash
âœ— docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 backend:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
